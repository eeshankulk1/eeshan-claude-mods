# Clickable Copy: puts the text behind a copy link on the clipboard.
#
# The clickable mod saves each code block it draws a copy link for as
# <store>/<id>.txt and links it as clickable-copy://<id>. The helper app hands
# the link it was opened with to this script, which copies that file and prints
# its first line for the notification. Only ids made of [0-9a-z] are read, so a
# link from anywhere else can name nothing outside the store. The set is spelled
# out because a range like 0-9a-z can match more in some locales.
